# Task Overview

## 📖 Storyline

More often and often students are getting lazy especially when it comes
to listening to lectures. While we all know that it's important to
listen to lectures, sometimes it's just not possible to do so.\
Or maybe you already know the materials, but the teacher has a special
way of treating his subject. This time you got the chance to listen to a
lecture of Mr. Whiskerstein.

The special part about his courses is the way in which he evaluates the
students. The evaluation is simple: provide the course word and get a
pass, otherwise you fail.

Thankfully the course word is not hidden, but to find it you have to
listen to his lectures where he one by one says the letters of the
course word during his lectures.

Now since you already know the subject and you are a smart engineer, you
know that you can use the power of AI to find the course word.

## 🎯 Objective

There's a lengthy stereo audio file (about 7 hours 50 minutes) rendered
in 44100 Hz sample rate in mp3 format.\
The audio contains AI generated texts, random words, different speeches
in different languages, acapella and some melodic elements.

There are hidden keywords somewhere in the audio and you have to find
all of them.

## 🚩 FLAG

All keywords have the following pattern:

    "The 1st letter in keyword is A, Alpha."
    "The 2nd letter in keyword is B, Beta."
    "The 3rd letter in keyword is C, Charlie."

For this example, the keyword would be **ABC**, and no, ABC is **not**
the keyword.

Keywords are placed consecutively in the audio.

## 📂 Task Input

## ✅ Task Output

Provide the identified flag, along with the solution for identifying it.

Make sure to include all the text identified by your solution from the
audio file to confirm your solution. (some missing letters or words are
allowed)

## 🏆 Scoring Criteria

You get a maximal score if you identify the flag correctly, and provide
the solution for identifying it, otherwise you get 0 points.

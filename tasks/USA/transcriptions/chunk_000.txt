Well now let me see, you know I don't have any idea what that means. Well I mean you're ready to rejoin society. I know what you think it means, I think. To me it's just a made-up word. Apoliticians were so good. Young fellows like yourself can wear a suit in a time. Have a job. But do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did? Align? There's not a day goes by, I don't feel regretten. Not because I'm in here because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then. A young, stupid kids would commit it to a terrible crime.

Humanoid. Let me tell you about a voice. Not this voice. But the one inside. The one that whisperers. It tells me which right and what's not. When to leave and where to go. It's not Shakespeare. It does not speak in memorable lines. My inner voice always gives it to me straight. Guilt middle, my real friends are. When to say yes. When to say no. Whether the person sitting next to me is the one I'll be spending the rest of my life with. Or not. Sometimes that voice is crystal clear. Low. Stay right. Wrong. Sometimes it nearly whisper. Celluloid. Humanoid. Detroit. Asteroid. Cue void. Delipsoid. Powerbow Lloyd. Deltoid. I have a dream. My four little children.

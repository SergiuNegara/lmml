 Horpe rapidly Laurometrius simply done a text of the printing and type setting industry Laurometrius has been industry standard done earlier of Titan and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic type setting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularized in the 1960s with the release of Letrus at Sheets containing Lauren Ipsum passages and more recently with desktoc publishing software like all disalloying, misery, and bleeding of need closure on the statement. Lauren ifsum is simply dummy text of the Prince. And um, that's it. I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to do this. First, I started up step-seener, virtual riot. Hello. It was a long way for you to come from an air-hack. Yes. You also have a little minimized with it. I saw it a little bit. You've been with it. Yes. I saw it a little bit. I've been in the extra for me. It's really nice to see you. I'm a big fan of you. It's really nice to meet you. I'm very happy to meet you. There are some games I like. I like it. But it's cool. I like it. I like it. I like it. That's awesome. It's nice to meet you. What's awesome is you have a really nice sound. I'm happy to meet you. It's nice to meet you. I think you're also a full space. Yes. And the music is also great. Everything is cool. Everything is futuristic. It's cool. It's a transformer and a robot and a alien. It's cool. It's cool. It's a little classic. But when you're in a large school, you have to be careful with what you want. And then I have a strong instrument. It's natural that when you want to play the sound, you have to train the sound. It's also nice to hear it. Everything is nice. Everything is in relation to the sound. And I feel like it's in the background. I just want to play this little sound. If you're playing it, you can really get up. And I have this enormous band with a mark. And it's full of energy. It's for a very good moment. It's a bit like the old street. That's what it's like. It's really cool. But for a few minutes. It was all for you. And you could also play it with me. And the flute and the guitar. It was also played for the night. And after 12 minutes, you were playing it out. And you got your room. And at this moment, we'll play it in the second 20 hours. Then we'll play it in the second 20 hours. And then I'll play it here. I'm really happy with this life. It's really funny. We can keep it in the room. We've always been in the second half of the show. We've been in the show for two hours. We've been in the show for two hours. We've been in the show for two hours. And we've been in the show for two hours. Okay. But when we have, we'll have a lot of time to be blinded. We'll have a little bit of time to play it. We'll have a little bit of time to play it. It's a little bit of a pain. It's a little bit of a pain. We can just make a bottle of water. That's like a chair. It's different. With a very good table. So with a sample, it's always good. It's cool. You can also make a stream. And here we have the toilet. You see? Yes. And here we have the toilet. We have the toilet. And here we have the toilet. And then we have the toilet. And then I'll put the toilet in. And then you get the paper. I'll put the paper in here. With this water bottle. And the nice thing is, you can put the toilet in. Okay. You can go to the rice. Yes. I can go to the kitchen. So many drops of water. I don't have any. But I have to put the toilet in. It's a bit complicated. I don't know. I can see the toilet. That's the sample from Drop. Great. It's cool. It's cool. What do you think is the biggest challenge to go to the bathroom to get the bathroom in the bathroom? I don't know. I don't know. It's not that it's a real toilet. It's a transformer. It's a double-word space. And it's a world-traum. The sense. It's an anextrate. You can see it's an art. You like something more fascinating. That's just something like. Perhaps when you're in a world-traum, not the art again that there's everything resemble what's红-<|ms|>. And it's not mid-silly but a lot of kindз. Its gl produção. It's like manipulation. It goes truly with the巨样. Some case tigers agitate the baby. But I will surelyš oftenay a god. Right. It works. It's like an art that's already following Star seam. but will be in 7 or 9,I think the original did better? So,let's just take one. And I'm paying off. Sometimes we keep doing events just once and what is important. Speaking with a lot of reasons like this, I think I can do this with a sports scene I could hardly get this bad at the moment without a movement, just do it a little bit. Well that is a Rush means a plug. Something is not cool. If courage doesn't turn up you can actually do a nice thing. Maybe for gamer books like this... We have myising bypass... The Rush is faster and sounds kind of flipped and fake. I always have a couple of bits. I talked now, I could have done faster when 찍otting is difficult to remember... ...where people want to have more fun in one line. Sometimes another시면 ziehen new tools. Then there are a lot of parameters, different directions. They can see the beautiful bustling. That's a... Full dark. I'm just going to play a game with time. I don't have to do everything. And it's possible. You know, the right thing is basically something. Yeah, full. So it's not that you don't want to know the best or the best. Me. And the right science fiction film. That's very nice. What's the theme for you? I just sent it. So definitely cause죄 dlatego她 usual interview series with若ilo flexible tit Bowax World game or something. But it had such a cool feeling before Running Up. The theme my mid fall on, a theme of movie music program, a dance for DJ. The theme for watchingholiday, you had to look at a maismitty one, when I got there, they found a place for my work first-endency classes, and heard myself at SHOOL IT, as long as the Super Masters score track from my show to study. You can also have the program and have the first cakewalk here. Here is a drum sampler and here is the last one. Then a sample and a hammer. And then a few two nights, a middle keyboard and then I got it. I was in the game mode because I had the internal release. The air suspension is in the G. What is that means?

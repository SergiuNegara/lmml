You know, I don't have any idea what that means. Well, that means you're ready to rejoin society. I know what you think it means, honey. To me, it's just a made-up word. The politicians work so that young fellows like yourself can wear a suit in a time, have a job. But do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did? Align? There's not a day goes by, I don't feel regretting. Not because I'm in here, because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then. A young, stupid kid, we committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try to talk some sass to him. Tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone. And this old man is all this left. I got to live with that.

But the one inside. The one that whispers. It tells me what's right and what's not. When to leave and where to go. It's not Shakespeare. It does not speak in memorable lines. My inner voice always gives it to me straight. Elf me to my real friends are. When to say yes. When to say no. Whether the person sitting next to me is the one I'll be spending the rest of my life with. Or not. Sometimes that voice is crystal clear. Go. Stay. Right. Wrong. Sometimes it merely whisper.

One day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.
